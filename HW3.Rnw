% QUESTION 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item This week's Problem of the Week in Math is described as follows:
\begin{quotation}
  \textit{There are thirty positive integers less than 100 that share a certain 
  property. Your friend, Blake, wrote them down in the table to the left. But 
  Blake made a mistake! One of the numbers listed is wrong and should be replaced 
  with another. Which number is incorrect, what should it be replaced with, and 
  why?}
\end{quotation}
The numbers are listed below.
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ccccc}
    6 & 10 & 14 & 15 & 21\\
    22 & 26 & 33 & 34 & 35\\
    38 & 39 & 46 & 51 & 55\\
    57 & 58 & 62 & 65 & 69\\
    75 & 77 & 82 & 85 & 86\\
    87 & 91 & 93 & 94 & 95
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
Use the fact that the ``certain'' property is that these numbers are all supposed
to be the product of \emph{unique} prime numbers to find and fix the mistake that
Blake made.\\
\textbf{Reminder:} Code your solution in an \texttt{R} script and copy it over
to this \texttt{.Rnw} file.\\
\textbf{Hint:} You may find the \verb|%in%| operator and the \verb|setdiff()| function to be helpful.\\

\textbf{Solution:} 
% Write your answer and explanations here.

## Create the real set as a vector
primes = c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47)
prime.products = c()
for(i in 1:length(primes)){
  prime.products = c(prime.products, primes[i]*primes[-i])
}
prime.products = prime.products[-which(prime.products>100)]
prime.products = unique(prime.products)
prime.products = sort(prime.products)

## Create the given set as a vector

given.products = c(6, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 26, 33, 34, 35, 38, 39, 46, 51, 55, 57, 58, 62, 65, 69,
                   75, 77, 82, 85, 86, 87, 91, 93, 94, 95)

## See where given.products does not equal prime.products to find the error

error = given.products[which(prime.products!=given.products)]
print(paste("The error is: ", error))
print(paste("The right answer is: ", prime.products[which(given.products==75)]))
